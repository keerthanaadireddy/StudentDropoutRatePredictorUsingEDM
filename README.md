# Student Dropout Rate Prediction Using Educational Data Mining

This project introduces Aura Predict, a web-based application designed to predict student dropout risk using educational data mining and machine learning techniques. The application helps identify students who may be at risk of dropping out, enabling early and informed intervention.

The system uses a real-world benchmark dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and evaluates multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Based on performance evaluation, the Random Forest model was selected and deployed as the prediction engine.

Aura Predict follows a modular architecture with a Flask-based backend that exposes REST APIs and a user-friendly web interface. The application supports both individual student predictions and batch analysis through CSV uploads, along with a dashboard view for high-level insights.

The project emphasizes practical deployment by bridging the gap between predictive modeling and real-world usability for educational institutions.
